##Q7  In the loan_data.csv, using SQL Can you create a custom UDF to calculate the debt-to-income ratio for each loan applicant?
 
 -- Create a custom UDF to calculate the debt-to-income ratio
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_dti(monthly_income REAL, monthly_debt REAL) RETURNS REAL
AS

    IF monthly_income > 0 THEN
        SET dti_ratio = monthly_debt / monthly_income;
    ELSE
        SET dti_ratio = NULL; -- Handle division by zero case
    END IF;
    
    RETURN dti_ratio;

FROM loan_data;


##Q8   In the loan_data.csv, using SQL find out what is the percentage share of Loans that are approved for applicants who have not graduated.

-- Calculate the total number of loans approved for applicants who have not graduated
WITH non_graduated_approved_loans AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_non_graduated_approved_loans
    FROM loan_data
    WHERE education_level <> 'Graduate' AND loan_status = 'Approved'

-- Calculate the total number of loans approved
total_approved_loans AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_total_approved_loans
    FROM loan_data
    WHERE loan_status = 'Approved'
)

-- Calculate the percentage share of loans approved for applicants who have not graduated
SELECT 
    (CAST(count_non_graduated_approved_loans AS FLOAT) / count_total_approved_loans) * 100 AS percentage_share_non_graduated_approved_loans
FROM 
    non_graduated_approved_loans, total_approved_loans;
	
	
	## Q9 In the loan_data.csv, using SQL Fetch information of Loans that are approved and whoâ€™s Loan Amount is greater than the Average Loan Amount of the Property Area they belong to.
	
	
	-- Calculate the average loan amount for each property area
WITH avg_loan_amount_per_area AS (
    SELECT 
        property_area,
        AVG(loan_amount) AS avg_loan_amount
    FROM 
        loan_data
    GROUP BY 
        property_area

-- Fetch information of loans that are approved and whose loan amount is greater than the average loan amount of the property area they belong to
approved_loans_above_avg_amount AS (
    SELECT 
        ld.*

    WHERE 
        ld.loan_status = 'Approved'
        AND ld.loan_amount > ala.avg_loan_amount
)

-- Select the required information from the final result
SELECT 
    *
FROM 
    approved_loans_above_avg_amount;



## Q10  In the loan_data.csv, using SQL Display the percentage of each Property Area category shared in the whole data set.


SELECT 
    property_area,
    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loan_data) AS percentage_share
FROM 
    loan_data
GROUP BY 
    property_area;
